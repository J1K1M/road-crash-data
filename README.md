# New Zealand Road Crash Data Analysis 2012-2022

## About the project

This analysis looks at all the records of road crashes reported by the police since the year 2000 all the way to the current year 2022.
We will be looking at the data from the last 10 years from 2012 to 2022 (present). The analysis was performed to look at the possible factors that could have led to a crash
such a speed, lighting condition, weather and use the information that can potentially help reduce the number of crashes and decrease the level of severity.
